        "For computers to understand human language, we must first represent words in digital form. The digitally represented words can then be used by machine learning models to perform any NLP task. Traditionally, methods like One Hot Encoding, TF-IDF Representation have been used to describe the text as numbers. But traditional methods have resulted in sparse representation by not grasping the meaning of the word.\n",
        "\n",
        "Neural Word Embeddings then came to the rescue by solving the problems in traditional ways. Word2Vec and GloVe are the two most commonly used word embedding elements. These methods have resulted in dense representations where words with similar meanings will have similar representations. A significant weakness of this method is that the words are considered to have only one meaning. But we know that a word can have many meanings depending on the context in which it is used.\n",
        "\n",
        "NLP has leapt forward in the modern family of language models. The incorporation of words is no longer independent of the context. The same word can have multiple digital representations depending on the context in which it is used. BERT, Elmo, ULMFit, GPT-2 are currently popular language models. The last generation is so good and some people see it as dangerous. The information written by these linguistic models was even deemed as credible as the New York Times by readers.\n"
