## 2. Mini NLP Projects

- Auto Correction Model: Autocorrect model referenced from the smartphones. When typing a word in the keyboard if the word exists in the vocabulary of the smartphone, then it will assume that the word is correct.
If the word doesn't exist in the smartphone vocabulary then the autocorrect is programmed to find the most similar words in the history of the smartphone.
- Election Result Prediction: Analysing the sentiments of people for the candidates and then at the end, concluing based on the most number of positive and negative tweets against the candidates.
- Keyword Extraction: Keyword extraction can be used in automatically indexing data, summarizing text, or generating tag clouds with most representative keywords.
- Movie Recommendation: A project to create a recommendation system based on IMDB Top 250 Lists and 5000 plus IMDB records A recommendation system predicts and filters user preferences after learning about the user's past choices.
- Named Entity Recognition: A task of NLP to identify named entities in a piece of text using LSTM.
- NLP for other langugaes: Using the integration of words for Indian languages, iNLTK (Natural Language Toolkit for Indic Languages) library. iNLTK gives the embedding vectors for the sentences written in Indian languages.
